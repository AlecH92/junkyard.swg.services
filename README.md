# junkyard.swg.services

This repository countains the source code of the [SWG Junkyard](http://junkyard.swg.services).

`combos.json`, `mods.json` and `base.json` are generated using the Python script on
the `json_generator.py`. Instructions for its use can be found within the script itself.

This does not yet use a Grunt or Gulp build system, so for now all you need to do to
build it is `bower install`.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
